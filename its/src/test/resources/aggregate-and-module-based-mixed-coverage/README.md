# Aggregate Maven project

A project with 5 modules:

1. [library](./library) - containing code but no tests
2. [library-clash](./library-clash) - containing a class whose name clashes with the one in `library`
3. [library.test](./library.test) - containing test code that uses code from `library`
4. [report](./report) - generating the aggregate coverage report
5. [self-covered](./self-covered) - containing code, tests and generating its own module-based coverage report


The report can be generated by running the following command:
```shell
mvn verify --file ./pom.xml
```
