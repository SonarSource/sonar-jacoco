# Aggregate Maven project

A project with 3 modules:

1. [library](./library) - containing code but no tests
2. [library.test](./library.test) - containing test code that uses code from `library`
3. [report](./report) - generating the aggregate coverage report


The report can be generated by running the following command:
```shell
mvn verify --file ./pom.xml
```
